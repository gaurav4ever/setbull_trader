The method under // Start precise 1-min ingestion and aggregation loop in cmd/trading/app/app.go is a background goroutine that, every minute (with a configurable offset), fetches all selected stocks, ingests their latest 1-minute candle data, and then aggregates these into 5-minute candles, firing an event for each. It logs timing accuracy and handles errors robustly.
Restated Query
You want a detailed, line-by-line analysis of the 1-min ingestion and aggregation loop, including how 5-min data is aggregated for every product case, with examples.
Detailed Line-by-Line Analysis
1. Goroutine Setup
Explanation:
offsetSeconds: Configurable delay after each minute boundary (e.g., 2s after 10:01:00).
now, nextMinute, nextTrigger: Calculate the next trigger time (e.g., if now is 10:01:01.500, nextTrigger is 10:02:02).
sleepDuration: Waits until the next trigger.
select: Exits if context is cancelled, otherwise sleeps until the next trigger.
Example:
If now = 10:01:01.500, offset = 2, nextMinute = 10:02:00, nextTrigger = 10:02:02, sleepDuration = 60.5s.

2. Fetching Stocks
Explanation:
Fetches all stocks currently selected for trading (across all groups).
Logs the count.
If error, logs and skips this cycle.
Example:
Suppose 3 stocks are selected: RELIANCE, TCS, INFY.

3. Ingesting 1-Minute Candles
Explanation:
For each stock:
Skips if no instrument key.
Ingests the latest 1-min candle (calls external API, stores in DB).
Aggregates the last 5x 1-min candles into a 5-min candle (from start to end).
Fires an event/notification for the new 5-min candle.
Example:
At 10:05:02, for RELIANCE:
Ingests 10:05 1-min candle.
Aggregates 10:01, 10:02, 10:03, 10:04, 10:05 into a 5-min candle (10:01–10:05).
Notifies downstream consumers (e.g., trading logic, UI).

4. Timing Accuracy Logging
Explanation:
Measures and logs the difference between intended and actual trigger time.
Warns if drift exceeds ±500ms.
5-Minute Aggregation: How It Works
General Principle
Aggregation: Combine 5 consecutive 1-min candles into a single 5-min candle.
Fields:
Open: Open of the first 1-min candle.
High: Max high of all 5 candles.
Low: Min low of all 5 candles.
Close: Close of the last 1-min candle.
Volume: Sum of all 5 volumes.

Edge Cases & Robustness
Missing Data: If a 1-min candle is missing, aggregation may skip or use partial data (depends on candleAggService logic).
API Failure: Errors are logged, but loop continues for other stocks.
Timing Drift: If ingestion/aggregation is delayed, drift is logged and can be monitored.

PROBLEM

 got the logic of the timing. But there is a problem which i'm facing. 

1. Market opens at 9:15AM. I get the 9:15-9:16AM candle at 9:16:08AM. 8 seconds delay. 
2. So, i'm getting 9:15-9:16AM candle data at 2025-05-19 09:16:08, 09:16:00-09:17:00 at 09:17:08, 09:17:00-09:18:00 at 09:18:08, 09:18:00-09:19:00 at 09:19:08 and 09:19:00-09:20:00 at 09:20:08. 
At each minute + 8 second offset, i'm getting a aggregated 5min candle even if 5minute is not completed yet (9:15:00 - 9:20:00 candle)
I'm getting aggregation based on 1minute, then 2min then 3min then 4min. Ideally i should get that 9:15-9:20 candle at 9:20:08 only. Not in between, there should be a time level check in my logic. 

Now in @group_execution_scheduler.go I have EntryTypeTriggerTimes as 9:20 and 13:05. 
If I choose 9:15 instead of 9:20, then it will trigger at 9:16:08 as aggregated 5min candle comes after 1st min and execution begins. 
If I choose 9:20 then aggregated candle comes at 9:21:08, but My entry should be exact at 9:20:08 as 9:19-9:20 candle closes. 

So there are 2 things
1. 5min aggregation problem
2. entry timing issue

What I think is, the logic should be based on timing. 
exactly at 9:20:08 second. My code should fetch 5min aggregation from 9:15-9:20AM. Before that there should not be any aggregation logic. Same goes for 13:05 entry


Analyze my problem statement first. Ask question if in doubt, analyze the code logic. 


You are facing two related but distinct issues:
5-min aggregation is being performed and made available before the full 5-minute window has actually elapsed (e.g., partial candles are being aggregated and exposed at 9:16:08, 9:17:08, etc., instead of only at 9:20:08 for the 9:15–9:20 window).
Entry trigger logic is not aligned with the true close of the intended 5-min window (e.g., a 9:20 entry is being triggered at 9:21:08, not at 9:20:08, or vice versa, depending on configuration).


Restated Problem (to confirm understanding):
You want:
The 5-min candle for 9:15–9:20 to be available only after 9:20:00 has passed (i.e., at 9:20:08, after all 1-min candles for 9:15, 9:16, 9:17, 9:18, 9:19 are available).
The entry trigger (e.g., for 9:20) to use the 5-min candle that truly covers 9:15–9:20, and to trigger as soon as that candle is available (e.g., at 9:20:08).
No partial 5-min candles should be created or exposed before the full window is complete.
You are currently seeing:
5-min aggregation logic is running every minute, so you get "partial" 5-min candles at 9:16:08, 9:17:08, etc., which is not correct.
Entry triggers are misaligned because the 5-min candle is not available at the expected time, or is based on incomplete data.

Analysis of Code Logic
1. Aggregation Logic in app.go
The loop runs every minute + offset.
For each stock, after ingesting the latest 1-min candle, it immediately calls

This means:
At 9:16:08, it tries to aggregate from 9:11:00 to 9:16:00 (but only 9:15:00+ candles exist, so you get a partial).
At 9:17:08, it tries 9:12:00–9:17:00, and so on.
At 9:20:08, it tries 9:15:00–9:20:00 (the correct window).
Problem:
The aggregation is attempted every minute, regardless of whether a full 5-min window is available.
This results in partial 5-min candles being created/exposed


2. Entry Trigger Logic in group_execution_scheduler.go
The scheduler listens for every 5-min candle close event.
It checks if the candle's time matches the configured trigger time (e.g., 9:20).
If you set 9:20, it will trigger when a candle with timestamp 9:20 is received.
But if the 5-min candle for 9:15–9:20 is only available at 9:21:08 (due to the aggregation logic), the entry is late.
If you set 9:15, it triggers at 9:16:08, which is too early and based on incomplete data.

Key Issues
Aggregation should only occur when a full 5-min window is available.
No partial 5-min candles should be created.
The aggregation should be triggered only at times that are multiples of 5 minutes after market open (e.g., 9:20:08, 9:25:08, etc.).
Entry triggers should be aligned with the actual availability of the correct 5-min candle.
The trigger for 9:20 should use the 5-min candle for 9:15–9:20, and should fire as soon as that candle is available (e.g., at 9:20:08).


Questions for Clarification
1. Is your 1-min ingestion always guaranteed to be available at minute+offset (e.g., 9:16:08 for 9:15–9:16)?
Or are there sometimes delays or missing data?
ANSWER: Yes, at 8th second offset of the minute, i get the data from broker. Its defined by the broker itself
2.Should the 5-min aggregation be strictly aligned to market open (e.g., 9:15–9:20, 9:20–9:25, etc.), or is there ever a need for rolling 5-min windows?
ANSWER: No rolling, strictly aligned to market open. 
3. Is it acceptable to only aggregate and expose 5-min candles at times that are multiples of 5 minutes after market open?
ANSWER: Yes. 
(e.g., only at 9:20:08, 9:25:08, etc.)
Should the entry trigger always fire as soon as the correct 5-min candle is available, or is there a need for additional delay/validation?
ANSWER  entry trigger always fire as soon as the correct 5-min candle is available

==================================================================


Direct Answer:
You need to change your aggregation and entry trigger logic so that:
5-min aggregation only happens at times that are multiples of 5 minutes after market open (e.g., 9:20:08, 9:25:08, etc.), and only when all 5 constituent 1-min candles are available.
Entry triggers fire immediately when the correct 5-min candle is available (no delay, no partials).
High-Level Design (HLD)
1. Precise 5-Min Aggregation Logic
Only aggregate and expose a 5-min candle when the current time is a multiple of 5 minutes after market open (e.g., 9:20:08, 9:25:08, ...).
For each such time, aggregate the 1-min candles for the window [T-5min, T) (e.g., for 9:20:08, aggregate 9:15:00–9:20:00).
Do not aggregate or expose partial 5-min candles at any other time.
2. Entry Trigger Logic
The entry trigger (e.g., for 9:20) should listen for the 5-min candle that covers [9:15, 9:20), and fire as soon as that candle is available (e.g., at 9:20:08).
The trigger should be based on the close time of the 5-min candle, not the time the event is received.
3. Scheduler/Loop
The ingestion loop should check if the current time is a 5-min boundary (since market open) before running aggregation and firing events.
The loop can still run every minute, but aggregation and event firing should only occur at the correct times.
Low-Level Design (LLD)
1. Aggregation Timing Check
Add a function to check if the current minute is a 5-min boundary since market open (e.g., (minute - marketOpenMinute) % 5 == 0).
Only call the 5-min aggregation logic if this check passes.
2. Aggregation Window Calculation
For each 5-min boundary time T, aggregate 1-min candles from [T-5min, T).
Ensure all 5 1-min candles are present before aggregating; if any are missing, skip aggregation and log a warning.
3. Entry Trigger Alignment
The scheduler should listen for 5-min candle close events.
When a 5-min candle with close time matching a configured entry time (e.g., 9:20) is received, fire the entry trigger immediately.
4. No Partial Aggregation
Do not aggregate or expose 5-min candles at any time other than the correct 5-min boundaries.

Example Timeline
| Time (HH:MM:SS) | 1-min Candle | 5-min Aggregation? | Entry Trigger? |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 09:16:08 | 09:15-09:16 | No | No |
| 09:17:08 | 09:16-09:17 | No | No |
| 09:18:08 | 09:17-09:18 | No | No |
| 09:19:08 | 09:18-09:19 | No | No |
| 09:20:08 | 09:19-09:20 | Yes (9:15-9:20) | Yes (if 9:20) |
| 09:21:08 | 09:20-09:21 | No | No |
| 09:25:08 | 09:24-09:25 | Yes (9:20-9:25) | Yes (if 9:25) |
Phase-wise Implementation Plan
Phase 1: 5-Minute Aggregation Logic
Update the ingestion loop to only aggregate 5-min candles at correct 5-min boundaries.
Add a helper function to check for 5-min boundaries since market open.
Ensure only full 5-min windows are aggregated.
Phase 2: Entry Trigger Alignment
Update the scheduler to listen for 5-min candle close events.
Fire entry triggers immediately when the correct 5-min candle is available.
Phase 3: Testing & Validation
Add unit tests for the 5-min boundary check and aggregation logic.
Add integration tests to ensure entry triggers fire at the correct times.


Phase 2 Implementation Plan
Files to Change:
internal/service/group_execution_scheduler.go
Key Steps:
Ensure the scheduler only triggers entries when a 5-min candle with the correct close time is received.
Align the trigger to the actual close time of the 5-min candle, not the event receive time.
(Optional) Add logging to confirm correct trigger timing.
Testing Strategy:
Add log lines to confirm that triggers only fire at the correct 5-min boundaries and for the correct entry types.
(Unit/integration tests will be added in Phase 3.)
Implementation Details
The scheduler already listens for 5-min candle close events and checks if the candle's time matches the configured trigger time (e.g., 9:20).
We will ensure that:
The trigger time check uses the candle's close time (not event receive time).
The trigger fires immediately when the correct 5-min candle is available.
No triggers fire for partial or misaligned candles.

====================================================================================================

You should put 9:20 in EntryTypeTriggerTimes if you want to enter immediately after the first full 5-min candle (covering 9:15–9:20) is available at 9:20:08.
Explanation
The scheduler now triggers based on the candle's close time (the end of the 5-min window).
The first 5-min candle covers 9:15:00–9:20:00 and is available at 9:20:08 (after all 1-min candles for that window are ingested and aggregated).
The EntryTypeTriggerTimes map should use the close time of the 5-min candle you want to act on.
If you set 9:15, the trigger would fire at 9:15:08, but there is no full 5-min candle at that time (market just opened).
If you set 9:20, the trigger will fire at 9:20:08, immediately after the first 5-min candle (9:15–9:20) is available.
Summary Table:
| EntryTypeTriggerTimes value | When does trigger fire? | Candle window used | Is this correct for your use case? |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 9:15 | 9:15:08 | (none/full candle not ready) | ❌ No (too early) |
| 9:20 | 9:20:08 | 9:15:00–9:20:00 | ✅ Yes (immediately after 1st 5-min) |

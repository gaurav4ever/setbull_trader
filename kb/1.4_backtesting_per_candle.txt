You want to analyze the daily_trades.csv to determine, for each stock, which EntryTimeString (e.g., 9:15, 10:15, etc.) yields the best performance. The output should show, for each EntryTimeString, the top-performing stocks (with a minimum number of trades) and their performance metrics.
Restated Query:
You want to update analyze_trades.py so that, for each possible EntryTimeString, it computes and displays the top-performing stocks (by average PnL or another metric), with a minimum trade count filter, and prints these results.
Approach & Reasoning:
Data: daily_trades.csv contains columns: Name (stock), EntryTimeString, PnL, etc.
Goal: For each EntryTimeString, group by Name, compute performance metrics (e.g., average PnL, win rate, total trades), filter by min trades, and display the top stocks.
Integration: Add a new section in analyze_trades.py after the existing analyses, iterating over all unique EntryTimeString values, and for each, print a table of top stocks.
Low-Level Design:
Load the CSV into a DataFrame.
For each unique EntryTimeString:
Group by Name, aggregate metrics (mean PnL, win rate, trade count).
Filter for min trades.
Sort by performance metric (e.g., mean PnL).
Print the top N stocks for that time.
Optionally, add a method in IntradayDataAnalysis for this, or do it directly in analyze_trades.py.
Proposed Phase Plan:
Phase 1:
Add a function in analyze_trades.py to compute and print top-performing stocks per EntryTimeString (using pandas directly).
Phase 2 (optional):
Refactor into IntradayDataAnalysis if you want to keep all analysis logic encapsulated.
Request for Confirmation:
Would you like to proceed with Phase 1 (add the logic directly in analyze_trades.py), or do you want this as a method in IntradayDataAnalysis (Phase 2)?
(Phase 1 is faster and keeps changes minimal; Phase 2 is more modular.)
Once you confirm, I will implement Phase 1 in analyze_trades.py as described.

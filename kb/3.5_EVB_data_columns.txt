you’re looking to exploit volatility extremes intelligently, both in trend-following and counter-trend scenarios using Bollinger Bands (BB).

Let’s break this down clearly:
✅ 1. Trend-Following Trade When BB is Narrow (Range Squeeze)
🎯 Objective:

Catch powerful breakouts from tight ranges, in the direction of the prevailing trend.
📌 Setup:
✅ Filter 1: BB Width is at/near lowest in N days

bb_width = (ta.bb(20, 2).upper - ta.bb(20, 2).lower) / ta.bb(20, 2).basis
is_squeeze = bb_width <= ta.lowest(bb_width, 20)

✅ Filter 2: Detect prevailing trend (e.g., price > 50 EMA or VWAP)

trend_up = close > ta.ema(close, 50)
trend_down = close < ta.ema(close, 50)

🔹 Entry:

    If squeeze & trend_up, wait for break above Upper BB → Go Long

    If squeeze & trend_down, wait for break below Lower BB → Go Short

🔁 Trade Logic:

    Breakout from compressed volatility in direction of momentum

🎯 Exit:

    Trail with ATR or partial exit at 1.5× BB width

✅ 2. Counter-Trend Reversal When BB Width is High
🎯 Objective:

Fade exhaustion moves when volatility is unusually expanded — i.e., “rubber band stretched.”
📌 Setup:
✅ Filter 1: BB Width is in top 10% of past 100 bars

is_expanded = bb_width >= ta.highest(bb_width, 100) * 0.9

✅ Filter 2: Candle close is outside BB + exhausted trend

    Use RSI > 70 or < 30 to confirm overextension

    Or price far from VWAP / 50 EMA

🔹 Entry:

    If expanded BB & price closes far above upper band & RSI > 70 → Short

    If expanded BB & price closes far below lower band & RSI < 30 → Long

This mimics "BB squeeze explosion exhaustion reversal" setups.
📈 Visual Summary
Context	BB Width	Trend Filter	Entry Signal
Trend Breakout	Very Low	EMA/VWAP direction	Break of BB in trend direction
Exhaustion Revert	Very High	RSI extreme + BB out	Revert back inside BB toward MA
🛠️ Tools You Can Use

    ta.bb() for BB bands and width

    ta.lowest() and ta.highest() for dynamic thresholds

    ta.ema(), ta.rsi() or VWAP for trend filters

📌 Strategic Edge
Strategy	Risk Profile	Win Rate	RR	Time to Target
BB Squeeze Trend	Moderate risk	High (with trend)	1.5–3x	Medium (1–2 hours)
BB Expansion Fade	High reward	Lower, but 2–5x	2–	

You want to extend the stock_candle_data table and backend logic to:
Record when a candle is in a "Bollinger Band squeeze" (very low BB width, i.e., range compression).
Record when a candle is in a "Bollinger Band expansion" (very high BB width, i.e., volatility expansion, possible reversal zone).
For each, store relevant quantitative values (e.g., BB width, squeeze/expansion flags, and possibly the price level at which reversal is likely).
Restated Query (to confirm):
You want to define, detect, and persist two new volatility regime signals per candle:
"Squeeze" (compressed BB width, potential breakout zone)
"Expansion" (expanded BB width, potential exhaustion/reversal zone)
And you want to clarify what exactly should be stored in the DB for each, and how to compute these in the context of your current Go backend.
Detailed Understanding (Based on Current System & Files)
1. Current System Recap
Candle data is stored in stock_candle_data (see @3.3_EVB_requirement_context.txt).
Indicators like MA, BB, VWAP are (or will be) calculated and stored per candle.
BB width is already calculated as:
bb_width = (BB_upper - BB_lower) / BB_middle
Squeeze: BB width is at/near lowest in N days (e.g., 20).
Expansion: BB width is in top 10% of past 100 bars.
2. What You Want to Add
For Each Candle:
BB Squeeze Range:
Is this candle in a squeeze? (bool/flag)
What is the BB width? (float)
What is the lowest BB width in N bars? (float, optional)
BB Expansion Range:
Is this candle in an expansion? (bool/flag)
What is the BB width? (float, same as above)
What is the highest BB width in N bars? (float, optional)
What is the "possible highest point of reversal"? (Do you mean the price at which reversal is likely, or just the BB upper/lower band at expansion?)
Possible DB Columns:
1. bb_width (float) — already planned
2. is_bb_squeeze (bool)
3. is_bb_expanded (bool)
4. bb_squeeze_threshold (float, optional)
bb_expansion_threshold (float, optional)
3. Technical Requirements (Draft)
Calculation:
For each new candle, calculate BB width.
Compare BB width to rolling min/max over N bars to set squeeze/expansion flags.
Optionally, store the threshold values used for comparison.
For expansion, if you want to store a "reversal price," clarify if this is the BB upper/lower band, the close, or something else.
Persistence:
Add new columns to stock_candle_data for the above.
Update repository and DTOs to handle new fields.
API/DTO:
Expose new fields in API responses if needed.

Questions for You (to Clarify Implementation)
Thresholds/Parameters:

1. What lookback period do you want for squeeze (lowest in N bars) and expansion (top X% in M bars)? Is 20 for squeeze and 100 for expansion correct?
Should these be configurable per instrument or hardcoded?
ANSWER: 20 for squeeze and 100 for expansion

2. What to Store:
- Do you want to store just the squeeze/expansion flags, or also the threshold values (min/max BB width) used for comparison?
ANSWER: I will store just the squeeze/expansion flags, the min and max BB width will be calculate afterwards and will be stored in a different table or a sheet to record this. 
- For "possible highest point of reversal" in expansion, do you want to store:
The BB upper/lower band value at that candle?
ANSWER: For every candle, store the width then we will calculate for each stock and for its data, what is the max possible average of BB width from where reversal has happened. That we will store. Since it will differ for each stock.
The actual price at which reversal is detected (e.g., close price)? NO
Or something else?
ANSWER: For every candle, store the width then we will calculate for each stock and for its data, what is the max possible average of BB width from where reversal has happened. That we will store. Since it will differ for each stock.

3. API Exposure:
- Should these new fields be exposed in all candle data APIs, or only in certain endpoints?
ANSWER: Yes, in all candle data APIs

4. Backfilling:
Do you want to backfill these new fields for historical data, or only compute for new candles going forward?
ANSWER: only compute for new candles going forward? 


Next Step:
Please confirm or clarify the above points, especially regarding what exactly you want to store for "reversal" and the lookback/threshold parameters. Once confirmed, I’ll write the precise technical requirements and propose a phase-wise implementation plan.



You want to add per-candle volatility regime signals (BB squeeze/expansion) to your backend, storing only the flags and BB width, with fixed lookbacks (20 for squeeze, 100 for expansion), and expose these in all candle APIs, but only for new candles going forward. You do not want to store reversal price/level per candle, but will analyze reversal zones separately.
1. Restated Understanding
Goal:
Enhance the stock_candle_data table and backend logic to:
Store BB width for each candle.
Store a flag if the candle is in a "squeeze" (BB width at/near lowest in last 20 bars).
Store a flag if the candle is in an "expansion" (BB width in top 10% of last 100 bars).
Expose these fields in all candle data APIs.
No backfilling; only compute for new candles.
No need to store reversal price/level per candle; that will be handled in separate analytics.

Ready to present the detailed file-by-file plan for Phase 1. Would you like to proceed with Phase 1 implementation?

Direct Answer:
is_bb_squeeze will be true if the current candle’s BB width is less than or equal to the minimum BB width observed in the last 20 candles for that stock (i.e., it is at/near the lowest volatility in the recent period).
is_bb_expanded will be true if the current candle’s BB width is greater than or equal to 90% of the maximum BB width observed in the last 100 candles for that stock (i.e., it is in the top 10% of volatility expansion for the recent period).
Thresholds:
Squeeze threshold: The minimum BB width in the last 20 candles (rolling window, per stock).
Expansion threshold: 90% of the maximum BB width in the last 100 candles (rolling window, per stock).
Stock-specific behavior:
These thresholds are relative to each stock’s own recent history (not absolute values). This means:
For each stock, the rolling min/max is calculated from its own BB width series.
The logic automatically adapts to each stock’s volatility regime, so a “squeeze” or “expansion” is always defined in the context of that stock’s own recent volatility, not compared to other stocks.
Elaboration & Example
For a given stock:
At each new candle:
Calculate BB width for the current candle.
Look back at the previous 20 candles for that stock, find the minimum BB width.
If current BB width ≤ min(BB width over last 20), set is_bb_squeeze = true.
Look back at the previous 100 candles for that stock, find the maximum BB width.
If current BB width ≥ 0.9 × max(BB width over last 100), set is_bb_expanded = true.
Example (for stock ABC):
Last 20 BB widths: [0.12, 0.13, ..., 0.10, 0.11]
min = 0.10
Current BB width = 0.10
0.10 ≤ 0.10 → is_bb_squeeze = true
Last 100 BB widths: [0.10, ..., 0.25, ..., 0.13]
max = 0.25
0.9 × 0.25 = 0.225
Current BB width = 0.23
0.23 ≥ 0.225 → is_bb_expanded = true
Summary:
The squeeze/expansion logic is always based on the stock’s own rolling window of BB width values.
This makes the regime detection adaptive and robust to different volatility profiles across stocks.
If you want to further customize thresholds per stock (e.g., based on sector, ATR, or other meta-data), that can be added later, but the current design is already stock-specific and adaptive.
Let me know if you want to see the exact code logic for this, or if you want to proceed with the implementation plan as described.


If the range keeps getting smaller after 20 candles (i.e., the BB width keeps making new lows), the rolling 20-candle minimum will keep updating to this new low. So, the "squeeze" flag will only be true for the candle(s) that match this new minimum.
However, if you want to avoid flagging every new local minimum as a "squeeze" (especially if the stock is in a long, persistent contraction), you need a more robust, statistically meaningful threshold—such as a "historical squeeze floor" or a percentile-based approach.
Elaboration
Current Logic (Rolling Min)
is_bb_squeeze = true if current width ≤ min(width over last 20 candles).
If the width keeps dropping, the min keeps dropping, so only the new lowest gets flagged.
This means:
If the squeeze persists and gets tighter, the flag will "move" with the new minimum, not stay true for the whole squeeze period.
Your Scenario
After 35 candles, the width is the smallest ever seen.
After backtesting 100 days, you find that the "average smallest width" for that stock is X.
You want to avoid flagging every new local minimum as a squeeze, and instead only flag when the width is "extremely low" compared to the stock's historical behavior.
More Robust Approaches
1. Historical Percentile Threshold
Calculate the 5th or 10th percentile of BB width over a long historical window (e.g., 100 days).
is_bb_squeeze = true if current width ≤ (10th percentile of historical widths).
This way, only "extreme" squeezes are flagged, not every new local minimum.
2. Absolute Historical Minimum
Use the all-time (or long-term) minimum width as a reference.
is_bb_squeeze = true if current width ≤ (some factor × historical min width).
This is more stable, but may be too restrictive for changing volatility regimes.
3. Hybrid: Rolling Min + Historical Floor
Use the rolling min for recency, but require that the width is also below a historical threshold (e.g., below the 10th percentile of all historical widths).
This prevents flagging every new local minimum in a persistent contraction.
Example (Percentile Approach)
Gather all BB widths for the last 100 days (or more).
Compute the 10th percentile width: say, 0.08.
is_bb_squeeze = true if current width ≤ 0.08.
Recommendation
For production/robust signal:
Use a percentile-based threshold (e.g., 10th percentile of historical BB widths for that stock).
For research/backtesting:
You can record all BB widths, and later analyze what percentile or absolute value best captures meaningful squeezes for each stock.
Implementation Suggestion
Short-term:
Stick with rolling min for now (as per your current plan), but also record BB width for every candle.
Long-term:
After collecting enough data, analyze the distribution of BB widths per stock, and set a more robust, stock-specific squeeze threshold (e.g., 10th percentile or average of historical minima).
Summary Table:
| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Rolling Min (current) | Adaptive, simple | Flags every new min, noisy |
| Historical Percentile | Robust, stock-specific | Needs more data, less adaptive to regime change |
| Hybrid | Balanced, robust | More complex logic |
Would you like to:
Proceed with the rolling min for now and plan for percentile-based squeeze detection later?
Or, do you want to implement percentile-based squeeze detection from the start (requires historical BB width data for each stock)?
Let me know your preference, and I’ll update the technical plan accordingly.



VERY IMPORTANT
We will only record the Bollinger Band width (bb_width) for each new candle in the database and API. No squeeze/expansion flags or thresholds will be implemented at this stage. This will allow you to analyze the BB width distribution later and define robust squeeze/expansion logic based on real data.

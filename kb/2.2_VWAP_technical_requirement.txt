Direct Answer (Summary):
What’s already done:
You have a robust, modular backtest framework for intraday strategies, with clear separation of API, strategy logic, data processing, and reporting.
Entry strategies (like 1ST_ENTRY, 2_30_ENTRY) are plug-and-play via a base interface and factory pattern.
The backtest pipeline is designed to run on multiple stocks, with all the necessary infrastructure for data loading, trade management, metrics, and reporting.
The system is ready for new entry/strategy types to be added with minimal changes to the core.
What’s needed for VWAP strategy:
Implement a new entry strategy class (e.g., VWAPEntryStrategy) that follows the same interface as existing ones.
Add VWAP calculation logic (if not already present) to the data processing pipeline so that candles have VWAP values.
Register the new strategy in the entry strategy factory.
Update configuration and test scripts to allow selection of the VWAP strategy for backtesting.
No major changes to the core pipeline are needed; the new strategy will be automatically compatible with the backtest runner, reporting, and API.
Restated Query (for confirmation):
You want to know, given your current modular backtest system (with API, data, strategy, and reporting layers), what is already implemented, and what exactly needs to be done to add a new VWAP-based entry strategy that can be backtested across all stocks using your existing pipeline.
1. Business/Product Understanding
Business Goal:
Systematically backtest and compare different intraday trading strategies (entry/exit rules) across a universe of stocks.
Enable rapid prototyping and evaluation of new strategies (like VWAP-based entries) with minimal code changes.
Maintain robust, scalable, and testable architecture for research and production.
Product Requirements:
Plug-and-play new entry/exit strategies.
Unified reporting and metrics for all strategies.
Ability to run backtests on multiple stocks, with consistent data handling and risk management.
API endpoints for triggering backtests and analyzing results.
2. Current State Analysis (from Directory & Code)
a. Project Structure & Key Components
API Layer:
main.py exposes endpoints for running backtests and analyzing results.
Backtest Orchestration:
test_mr_strategy.py and mr_strategy/backtest/runner.py handle configuration, orchestration, and reporting.
Core Backtest Engine:
mr_strategy/backtest/engine.py runs the actual backtest logic, including signal generation and trade management.
Data Processing:
mr_strategy/data/data_processor.py loads and processes candle data, including technical indicators.
Strategy Logic:
mr_strategy/strategy/entry_strategies/ contains entry strategy classes (e.g., first_entry.py, two_thirty_entry.py), all inheriting from a common EntryStrategy base.
mr_strategy/strategy/signal_generator.py uses the selected entry strategy to generate signals.
Trade Management:
mr_strategy/strategy/trade_manager.py handles trade lifecycle, P&L, and risk management.
Extensibility:
New entry strategies can be added by subclassing EntryStrategy and registering in the factory.
b. What’s Already Implemented
Strategy Plug-in System:
Existing strategies (1ST_ENTRY, 2_30_ENTRY) are implemented as classes, easily swappable via config/factory.
Data Pipeline:
Candle data is loaded, processed, and indicators can be added (ATR, VWAP, etc.).
Backtest Pipeline:
Handles multiple stocks, strategies, and produces detailed reports.
API & CLI:
Backtests can be triggered via API or script.
3. What Needs to be Done for VWAP Strategy
a. VWAP Calculation
Check if VWAP is already calculated in CandleProcessor or IntradayDataProcessor.
If not, add VWAP calculation so that each candle has a vwap field.
b. New Entry Strategy Class
Create VWAPEntryStrategy in mr_strategy/strategy/entry_strategies/vwap_entry.py:
Inherit from EntryStrategy.
Implement logic for entry signals based on VWAP (e.g., price crossing above/below VWAP, or other VWAP-based rules).
Implement check_entry_conditions and reset_state.
c. Register in Factory
Update entry_strategies/factory.py:
Register the new strategy with a unique key (e.g., "VWAP_ENTRY").
d. Configuration & Testing
Update config in test scripts and API to allow "entry_type": "VWAP_ENTRY".
Add/extend unit tests in test_entry_strategies.py for the new strategy.
e. (Optional) Reporting/Visualization
If you want VWAP-specific metrics or plots, extend reporting as needed.
4. How the New Strategy Will Plug In
No changes needed to the core pipeline.
The new strategy will be picked up by the factory and used by the signal generator.
All data loading, trade management, and reporting will work as before.
You can backtest the VWAP strategy across all stocks by specifying it in the config.
5. Summary Table
| Step | File/Module to Touch | What to Do |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| VWAP Calculation | CandleProcessor/IntradayDataProcessor | Ensure VWAP is calculated for each candle |
| VWAP Entry Strategy | entry_strategies/vwap_entry.py | Implement VWAP-based entry logic |
| Register in Factory | entry_strategies/factory.py | Register "VWAP_ENTRY" |
| Config/Testing | test_mr_strategy.py, API, tests | Add config/tests for VWAP strategy |
| (Optional) Reporting | Reporting modules | Add VWAP-specific metrics/plots if needed |
6. Next Steps
Confirm VWAP calculation is present or add it.
Design the VWAP entry logic (DESIGN FIRST if you want a design doc).
Implement the new entry strategy class.
Register and test.

=======================================================================

VWAP strategy details 

Behavior Criteria:
Only consider stocks with a clear trend (bullish or bearish) as defined by your trend filter.
The stock must pull back to the VWAP after trending away from it (i.e., first touch of VWAP after a trend move).
Only the first touch of VWAP after the trend move is considered for a potential trade.
Entry Criteria:
After the first touch of VWAP, look for a specific price action pattern (to be defined) that confirms resumption in the direction of the trend.
Entry can be on the same candle as the touch, or after 1–3 candles if a confirmation pattern appears.
The entry must be quantifiable and repeatable (e.g., close above VWAP for bullish, or a bullish engulfing candle after touch, etc.).

Restated Problem (for confirmation):
You want to formalize a VWAP-based strategy where:
You only consider stocks in a strong trend.
You wait for a pullback to VWAP (first touch after the trend move).
Only after this behavior, you look for a precise, quantifiable entry pattern to trigger a trade.
You want help in defining and quantifying this entry pattern so it can be coded and backtested.

1. Behavior Criteria (VWAP Context Filter)
A. Trend Filter
Use your existing trend logic (e.g., price above EMA50 for bullish, below for bearish, or other momentum filter).
Only consider stocks that pass this filter.
B. Pullback to VWAP (First Touch)
After a trend move away from VWAP, wait for the first time price returns to (touches or crosses) the VWAP.
Ignore subsequent touches for the same trend leg (only first touch is valid).
This is your "setup" or "context" filter.
How to Quantify:
Track if price has been above (bullish) or below (bearish) VWAP for N consecutive candles (e.g., 3+).
Mark the first candle where price touches or crosses VWAP after this trend move as the "first touch."
Only after this event, start looking for entry signals.

	1. Most of the time, I get losses in 1st entry. Simply means I was wrong technically. 
		a. But was not wrong overall. Price did goes to my direction after removing me. 
		b. Here, I can observe that if a bearish stock already touched the MR high in Intraday then my expectation of it going down immediately comes at risk.  
			i. This is my new risk. I need to asses and change my decisions immediately. 
			ii. So I need a automated scalable way of doing it. 
	2. When I get loss in 1st Entry or not get any entry overall. I should be triggered on the expectation of the market behavior based on previous backtesting. 
		a. That means, switching to BB width based trading
		b. Or trading at best available average level for that stock's trend. 
	3. So, at any point of time, I should have knowledge of what exactly to do objectively. 
On my best backtested stocks, if I follow this for 1month, I will improve 1000x.

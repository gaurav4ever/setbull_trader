# Root Cause Analysis Summary & Solution Implementation
*Date: 2025-07-18 | Instrument: NSE_EQ|INE301A01014*

## **1. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION**

### **1.1 Issue Summary**
- **5-minute aggregated data** showed significantly higher error rates compared to 1-minute data
- **BB Width errors**: Up to 82% difference from TradingView benchmarks
- **BB Band errors**: Up to 3.12% difference from TradingView benchmarks
- **Impact**: Incorrect squeeze detection and trading signals

### **1.2 Error Comparison**
| Metric | 1-Min Data Error | 5-Min Data Error | Error Ratio |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| BB Upper | 0.01-0.06% | 0.01-1.52% | 25x higher |
| BB Middle | 0.001-0.025% | 0.02-1.82% | 73x higher |
| BB Lower | 0.0002-0.18% | 0.02-3.12% | 17x higher |
| BB Width | 0.01-32% | 4-82% | 2.6x higher |

## **2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **2.1 Primary Root Cause**
**Incorrect Technical Indicator Aggregation**

**What Was Wrong**:
```sql
-- ❌ PROBLEMATIC CODE
five_min_complete AS (
    SELECT
        f.open, f.high, f.low, f.volume, f.vwap_5min,
        s.close, s.bb_upper, s.bb_middle, s.bb_lower, s.bb_width  -- ❌ Copying from 1-min data
    FROM five_min_open f
    JOIN stock_candle_data s ON s.instrument_key = f.instrument_key
    AND s.timestamp = f.period_end  -- ❌ Taking indicators from last 1-min candle
    AND s.time_interval = '1minute'
)
```

**The Problem**:
1. **OHLCV Data**: Correctly aggregated from 1-minute to 5-minute periods
2. **Technical Indicators**: Incorrectly copied from the last 1-minute candle
3. **Result**: BB calculations were based on 1-minute data but applied to 5-minute candles

### **2.2 Why This Caused Errors**
- **BB Middle**: Should be calculated from 5-minute close prices, not 1-minute
- **BB Upper/Lower**: Should use 5-minute standard deviation, not 1-minute
- **BB Width**: Should reflect 5-minute volatility, not 1-minute volatility

## **3. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION**

### **3.1 Corrected SQL Query**

**New Approach**:
```sql
-- ✅ CORRECTED CODE
WITH 
    -- Step 1: Aggregate OHLCV data correctly
    five_min_basic AS (
        SELECT 
            instrument_key,
            FLOOR(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timestamp) / 300) * 300 AS bucket_timestamp,
            MIN(timestamp) AS period_start,
            MAX(timestamp) AS period_end,
            MAX(high) AS high,
            MIN(low) AS low,
            SUM(volume) AS volume,
            SUM(close * volume) / SUM(volume) AS vwap_5min
        FROM stock_candle_data
        WHERE time_interval = '1minute'
        GROUP BY instrument_key, bucket_timestamp
    ),
    -- Step 2: Calculate BB indicators for 5-minute periods
    five_min_bb AS (
        SELECT 
            *,
            -- Calculate 20-period moving average for BB middle
            AVG(close) OVER (
                ORDER BY bucket_timestamp 
                ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            ) AS bb_middle_5min,
            -- Calculate 20-period standard deviation for BB bands
            STDDEV(close) OVER (
                ORDER BY bucket_timestamp 
                ROWS BETWEEN 19 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            ) AS bb_std_5min
        FROM five_min_close
    ),
    -- Step 3: Calculate final BB indicators
    five_min_final AS (
        SELECT 
            *,
            bb_middle_5min + (2 * bb_std_5min) AS bb_upper_5min,
            bb_middle_5min - (2 * bb_std_5min) AS bb_lower_5min,
            ((bb_middle_5min + (2 * bb_std_5min)) - (bb_middle_5min - (2 * bb_std_5min))) / bb_middle_5min * 100 AS bb_width_5min
        FROM five_min_bb
    )
```

### **3.2 Key Improvements**

       WHEN candle_count > 5 THEN 'EXTRA_CANDLES'
       ELSE 'COMPLETE_PERIOD'
   END AS period_status,
   CASE 
       WHEN bb_width_5min IS NULL THEN 'MISSING_BB_DATA'
       WHEN bb_width_5min < 0 THEN 'INVALID_BB_WIDTH'
       ELSE 'VALID_BB_DATA'
   END AS bb_data_status
   ```

2. **Implement alerting** for data quality issues
3. **Create validation dashboard** for real-time monitoring

## **7. SUCCESS METRICS**

### **7.1 Data Accuracy Targets**
- **BB Width Error**: < 5% (vs previous 60-80%)
- **BB Band Error**: < 0.5% (vs previous 1-3%)
- **Squeeze Detection Accuracy**: > 95%

### **7.2 System Performance Targets**
- **Query Execution Time**: < 5 seconds for full day data
- **Data Quality Score**: > 99% valid periods
- **Zero Critical Errors**: No invalid BB calculations

## **8. CONCLUSION**

The root cause of the 5-minute data errors was **incorrect technical indicator aggregation**. The original query copied BB indicators from 1-minute candles instead of recalculating them based on 5-minute OHLCV data.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Corrected SQL query with proper BB calculation
- ✅ Uses 5-minute close prices for moving average
- ✅ Calculates standard deviation from 5-minute data
- ✅ Provides accurate BB width based on 5-minute volatility

**Expected Outcome**:
- **17-73x reduction** in BB band errors
- **Accurate squeeze detection** for 5-minute timeframes
- **Reliable trading signals** based on correct volatility assessment

**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy corrected query to production
2. Validate against TradingView benchmarks
3. Monitor data quality and trading performance
4. Gradually resume 5-minute based trading strategies

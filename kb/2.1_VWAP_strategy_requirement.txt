Title: VWAP-Enhanced Intraday Trading System for 5-Minute Chart Strategy
Owner: [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]
Version: 1.0
üîç 1. Executive Summary

We aim to enhance our 5-minute intraday trading strategy by integrating VWAP-based trading logic. This initiative will enable us to capture more accurate directional entries, improve execution efficiency, and increase the overall win rate across the top-trending stocks.

This requirement is informed by proven institutional trading practices where VWAP serves as a core execution and signal tool. We want to adopt a similar structure tailored to our shorter timeframes and dynamic stock filtering process.
üéØ 2. Business Objective

    Integrate VWAP logic into our 5-minute chart-based intraday strategy.

    Improve trade quality by executing only around statistically favorable VWAP patterns.

    Achieve a 50%+ success rate across selected top 3‚Äì5 trending stocks.

    Ensure a fully automated system with trade journaling and backtest support.

üìå 3. Problem Statement

    The current system operates on breakout and trend-following setups over 5-minute charts using a curated set of trending stocks. However, lack of context from volume-weighted price levels (VWAP) sometimes leads to premature or low-probability entries.

    Professional-grade trading algorithms often rely on VWAP not just for execution efficiency but as a signal for continuation, reversal, or confirmation. Incorporating this dimension can significantly enhance our system‚Äôs accuracy and fill quality.

üß≠ 4. Key Business Requirements
ID	Requirement
BR-1	System must calculate real-time VWAP using 1-min or tick data feed.
BR-2	System must process VWAP signals at 5-minute intervals.
BR-3	VWAP strategy must trigger only for top 3‚Äì5 trending stocks (long/short).
BR-4	Must support VWAP breakout, VWAP rejection, and VWAP reversion signal types.
BR-5	Execution module must place, monitor, and exit trades via broker API.
BR-6	Include configurable SL/TP, position sizing rules, and risk constraints.
BR-7	Maintain journaling, logging, and session timeline for all trades.
BR-8	Include support for backtest and real-time simulation for validation.
BR-9	Enable integration with existing 5-minute breakout strategy engine.
üß™ 5. Success Metrics

    50% or higher win rate on VWAP-based trades among top trending stocks.

    Seamless integration with the current live trade engine.

    Execution latency < 1 second from signal to order placement.

    System resilience with zero missed 5-min intervals.

    Trackable improvement in RR, fill quality, and slippage.

üß± 6. Dependencies

    Real-time market data feed (tick or 1-min bars).

    Broker API integration (e.g., Upstox, Zerodha).

    Access to trending stock filters (based on momentum, volume, or price action).

    Existing journaling and backtesting infrastructure.

üöß 7. Constraints

    Latency of broker or data provider may impact VWAP freshness.

    Tick-level VWAP may require rate-limited APIs or separate data infra.

    Only intraday positions; all trades must be closed by 3:15 PM.

Product Requirement Document (PRD)

Product Name: VWAP Breakout Execution Engine
Version: 1.0
Prepared For: Product & Engineering Team
Prepared By: [Your Name]
Date: [Insert Date]
üß≠ 1. Product Overview

We are building an MVP system to automatically identify and execute VWAP breakout trades on 5-minute intraday charts using a pre-ranked set of top trending stocks (3‚Äì5 symbols). The product will integrate into an existing real-time technical indicator framework that supports VWAP computation.

This MVP focuses only on execution of VWAP breakout signals, and excludes logging, journaling, and backtesting.
üéØ 2. Goals & Scope
‚úÖ Included in Scope:

    Real-time signal evaluation every 5 minutes

    VWAP breakout signal logic

    Broker order placement (market order + optional SL/TP)

    Configurable risk and SL %

    Stock filter: Use only predefined list of top trending stocks (long or short)

    Runs from market open to 3:15 PM

‚ùå Out of Scope (MVP):

    VWAP rejection/reversion

    Trade journaling and timeline

    Performance tracking or analytics

    Backtest support

    UI/dashboard

üîç 3. Functional Requirements
FR-1: VWAP Signal Computation

    Reuse the existing technical indicator engine to compute real-time VWAP using tick or 1-minute feed

    Refresh VWAP at 1-minute granularity

    At every 5-minute candle close, compare current price with VWAP

FR-2: Signal Logic ‚Äì VWAP Breakout
LONG Signal:

    If close of 5-min candle > VWAP + breakout_buffer ‚Üí generate BUY signal

SHORT Signal:

    If close of 5-min candle < VWAP - breakout_buffer ‚Üí generate SELL signal

Params:
Parameter	Type	Default	Description
breakout_buffer	float	0.1%	How much price should exceed VWAP
min_volume	number	100,000	Min volume in the last 5-min candle
max_spread	float	0.2%	Max allowed bid-ask spread

    Signal must only be evaluated for top N stocks (e.g., 3-5), filtered separately via external service.

FR-3: Trade Execution

    Place market order via broker API (Zerodha, Upstox, etc.)

    Must support:

        Quantity based on risk config

        SL as absolute or % below VWAP

        Target is optional for MVP

    Must prevent duplicate entries on repeated signals

Execution Plan Example:

{
  "symbol": "RELIANCE",
  "direction": "BUY",
  "entry_price": 2482.0,
  "vwap": 2478.5,
  "sl": 2474.5,
  "quantity": 100
}

FR-4: Risk Management

    Fixed per-trade risk (risk_per_trade = ‚Çπ50)

    SL is based on:

        0.5% from VWAP by default OR

        user-configurable

    Quantity is calculated as:

qty = floor(risk_per_trade / (entry_price - stop_loss))

    No pyramiding or averaging in MVP

FR-5: Scheduler & Timing Logic

    Engine starts at 9:14 AM IST

    Runs until 3:15 PM IST

    Evaluates signal every 5 minutes (based on 5-min OHLC)

    No trade allowed after 3:00 PM

üß± 4. Technical Constraints
Constraint	Description
VWAP Service	Already exists ‚Äì do not rebuild
Broker API	Must support live trading + paper mode
Max trades per session	5 (configurable)
Candle Aggregation	From tick or 1-min feed to 5-min bar
üß™ 5. Testing & Validation
Test Case	Success Criteria
Signal triggers on breakout	Signal generated only when price crosses VWAP
Order placed for valid signal	Market order placed with correct SL
No double entries per symbol	Only one position allowed per symbol
Quantity respects risk settings	Correct quantity calculated
Scheduler limits respected	No orders after 3:00 PM
üßë‚Äçüíª 6. API/Integration Notes

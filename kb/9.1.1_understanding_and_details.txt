- **Strategy Engine**: Python-based backtesting framework with multiple entry strategies
- **Technical Stack**: PostgreSQL, Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript

### 1.2 Trading Strategies Implemented

#### A. Primary Entry Strategies
1. **1ST_ENTRY (First Entry Strategy)**
   - Entry at 9:15 AM market open breakouts
   - Uses morning range (MR) high/low with 0.07% buffer
   - Focus on immediate momentum capture

## 5. CONCLUSION

The SetBull Trader system demonstrates a sophisticated approach to algorithmic trading with strong technical 
foundations and multiple implemented strategies. 
However, the current challenges highlight the critical need for:

1. **Objective Decision Making**: Replace subjective analysis with quantified rules
2. **Performance-Based Strategy Selection**: Implement real-time switching based on results
3. **Enhanced Risk Management**: Comprehensive position and portfolio-level controls
4. **System Optimization**: Complete planned performance improvements

The path forward should focus on addressing the 1ST_ENTRY performance issues, 
implementing the BB_WIDTH_ENTRY strategy more aggressively, and creating a robust framework for objective strategy evaluation and switching. With these improvements, the system has the potential to achieve the stated goal of "1000x improvement" through systematic, data-driven trading decisions.

The foundation is solid; the focus should now be on execution excellence and continuous performance 
optimization based on real market results rather than theoretical backtests alone.

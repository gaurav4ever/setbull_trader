Issues that I have observed based on backtesting.

Problems
1. Code is able to catch the right squeeze threshold. 
2. I have written a logic where it will check for at least 3-5 counter of candles in squeeze threshold in order to consider it as a tradable range. 
3. But once i debug to 3rd or 5th candle, the code is jumping to next possible squeeze. its not putting the position there. 
4. Ideally if, atleast 3 candles are in squeeze then signal should be generated with entry at BB_UPPER level.
5. Any candle having high above the entry level will be executed. 


Solution
1. Removed the self.squeeze_candle_count <= self.squeeze_duration_max) logic, this was not abrubtly breaking the squeeze conditions afterwards. 
2. candle high above bb upper should be the trigger, not the close. 
3. Increased sl from 0.2% to 0.5%

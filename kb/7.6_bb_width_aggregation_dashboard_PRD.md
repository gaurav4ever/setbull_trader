# Bollinger Band Width Aggregation Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Vision Statement
Create a comprehensive real-time dashboard for monitoring Bollinger Band Width patterns across multiple stocks. The dashboard will enable traders to identify and act on volatility squeeze opportunities with enhanced data aggregation and alerting capabilities. Bollinger Band Width is abbreviated as BBW throughout this document.

### 1.2 Business Context
Based on the existing volatility squeeze trading strategy, this dashboard will provide the following capabilities:
- Real-time monitoring of BBW contractions across multiple stocks
- Historical analysis and threshold tracking
- Advanced alerting when stocks approach optimal trading ranges
- Data aggregation to support pattern recognition and decision making

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Pain Points
The following pain points have been identified in the current trading workflow:

1. **Manual Monitoring**: Traders must manually check individual stocks for BBW patterns, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
2. **Limited Historical Context**: It is difficult to compare current BBW values against historical minimums without proper tooling.
3. **Delayed Detection**: There are no real-time alerts when stocks enter optimal trading ranges, causing missed opportunities.
4. **Scattered Data**: BBW data exists in the system but is not aggregated for comparative analysis across multiple stocks.
5. **Missing Dashboard**: There is no centralized view of stocks approaching squeeze conditions, making monitoring inefficient.

### 2.2 Business Impact
The identified pain points result in the following business impacts:
- **Missed Opportunities**: Delayed detection of optimal trading conditions leads to missed entry points and reduced profitability.
- **Inefficient Analysis**: Manual monitoring severely limits the number of stocks that can be tracked simultaneously.
- **Poor Risk Management**: Lack of real-time data and historical context affects position sizing and timing decisions.

## üí° **SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES**

### 1. Replace Manual Map Operations with Gota:
```go
// BEFORE: 150+ lines of manual mapping
ma9Map := make(map[time.Time]float64)
for _, v := range ma9 {
    ma9Map[v.Timestamp] = handleNaN(v.Value)
}
// ... repeat 12 more times

// AFTER: Using Gota DataFrame
df := gota.LoadStructs(candles)
df = df.Mutate(
    series.New(calculateMA(df.Col("close").Float(), 9), series.Float, "MA9"),
    series.New(calculateBB(df.Col("close").Float()), series.Float, "BBUpper"),
    // ... all indicators in one operation
)
```

### 2. Replace Manual Statistics with Gonum:
```go
// BEFORE: Manual standard deviation calculation
func calculateStdDev(values []float64) float64 {
    mean := 0.0
    for _, v := range values {
        mean += v
    }
    mean /= float64(len(values))
    
    variance := 0.0
    for _, v := range values {
        variance += math.Pow(v-mean, 2)
    }
    return math.Sqrt(variance / float64(len(values)))
}

// AFTER: Using Gonum
import "gonum.org/v1/gonum/stat"

stdDev := stat.StdDev(values, nil)
```

### 3. High-Performance Caching:
```go
// Using fastcache for indicator caching
cache := fastcache.New(100 * 1024 * 1024) // 100MB cache

key := fmt.Sprintf("bb_%s_%d", symbol, timestamp)
if cached := cache.Get(nil, []byte(key)); cached != nil {
    // Use cached result
    return unmarshalIndicator(cached)
}

// Calculate and cache
result := calculateBollingerBands(candles)
cache.Set([]byte(key), marshalIndicator(result))
```

What is it that I'm trying achieve ?

1. Need to select 3 stocks that I will trade for a week
    - Selection based on manual analysis
    - SL should be pre-decided. Will be different for different stock.
    - 0.5% - 0.8% SL
2. These 3 stocks should be on the Main UI, with 3 different boxes
3. Each stock should have the following options as input
    1. Execution starting price
    2. Defined SL %
    3. Risk - Pre-filled as 30 rupees. 
    4. A check box near the Name of stock. 
        - If checked, then only that stock will be selected for execution
4. A common place order button which will execute the Trade on the selected stocks. 
5. Execution criteria
    1. Starting price -> 100 rupees let's say
    2. SL% -> 0.5% => 100*0.005 => 0.5 sl_points (rounded to 2 decimal place) => 99.5 sl_value
    3. Risk -> 30 rupees
    4. QTY => (risk/sl_points) => 30/0.5 => 60 QTY
    5. Initial Legs = 5  => qty/leg_size => 60/5 => 12 stocks per leg
    6. Leg execution criteria
        1. 12 stocks to be executed at 100. 
        2. 12 stocks to be executed at

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific phase? I can provide detailed code changes for each phase, starting with the one you prefer. Please let me know which phase you'd like to begin with, and I'll provide the specific implementation details.
Also, I have a few questions to ensure the implementation aligns with your needs:
Do you want to maintain backward compatibility with your existing codebase, or are you open to breaking changes for better architecture?
Are there specific technical indicators from pandas-ta that you'd like to prioritize?
Do you have any specific requirements for the performance metrics dashboard?
What is your preferred approach for handling slippage and transaction costs in backtesting?
Please let me know your preferences, and I'll proceed with the detailed implementation of the chosen phase.

@requirements.txt I already have some. But I don't know where to start. 
What I have?
1. A go backend which provides the APIs. @server.go 
2. calculate_atr method in @data_processor.py -> indicator service. 
3. backtesting engine which can execute a pipeline for my First 5min morning Range MR strategy in Top 10 filtered stocks. 

I'll help you understand what you have and how to proceed with implementing your trading strategy using the awesome-quant repository as a reference.
From your current setup, you have:
Go Backend (server.go)
REST API endpoints for:
Stock universe management
Candle data retrieval
Order execution
Filter pipeline
Historical data
Trade management
Python Data Processing (data_processor.py)
ATR calculation
Candle data processing
Morning range extraction
Trading day handling
Backtesting Engine
Pipeline execution for MR strategy
Top 10 filtered stocks processing
To integrate with awesome-quant and enhance your system, here's what you should do:
First, set up your Python environment with additional dependencies:
Create a Strategy Base Class:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
MorningR
Implement Data Feed Integration:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
candles
Create Backtest Runner:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
results
Implement Performance Analysis:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
profit
Create Strategy Pipeline:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
stats
To get started:
First, install the additional dependencies:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
Run
txt
Create the directory structure:
Apply to 1.5_awesome_...
Run
py
Start implementing each component, beginning with:
Data feed integration with your Go backend
Morning range calculation
Basic strategy implementation
Backtest runner
Performance analysis
Would you like me to help you implement any specific component in more detail?
Based on existing code . What exact your will plan to execute ? I need a V2 files so that I can understand and differentiate them better. 
Present me a phase wise incremental implementation plan for existing code and @https://github.com/wilsonfreitas/awesome-quant  libraraies from awesome quant. 
1. Integration should be smooth and bugs should not come.
2. If anywhere in doubt, ask me questions
3. Make sure each phase or subphase should only have 1-2 code file changes/modification. 
Be specific on requirement and do not add extra knowledge.


I'll analyze your existing codebase and create a phase-wise implementation plan that integrates with awesome-quant libraries. Let me first understand your current structure and then propose a V2 plan.
First, let me examine your current codebase structure:
Based on the codebase analysis, I'll create a phase-wise implementation plan for V2 that integrates with awesome-quant libraries. Each phase will focus on specific improvements while maintaining compatibility with your existing code.

1. No.  open to breaking changes for better architecture.
2. I want EMA 50, 9 & 5, RSI and ATR. I can change their parameters also. So make it scalable
3. metrics are mentioned in Terminal lines 701-718
4. No thought, exlcude for now.

1. Executive Summary

The Stock Trading Intelligence System (STIS) is a data-driven decision support tool that analyzes historical trade data to provide actionable daily trading recommendations. By combining correlation analysis and sequence prediction, STIS identifies which stocks to trade and their expected performance. The system addresses a critical gap in our current trading infrastructure by using pattern recognition to maximize trading effectiveness.

Key Deliverables:

    Correlation analysis engine to identify related stocks
    Sequence prediction model to forecast trading outcomes

TECH TEAM - HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS 

Trading Strategy Enhancement: Correlation Analysis and Sequence Prediction
1. Current Problem
The current trading system generates backtesting results for multiple stocks across different dates, capturing metrics such as P&L, trade direction, status (win/loss), and R-multiples. However, it lacks sophisticated analysis to:

Identify correlated stocks that tend to move together or in opposite directions
Predict future trade outcomes based on historical sequences of wins and losses
Prioritize trading candidates for the current day based on probability of success
Estimate potential P&L magnitudes for upcoming trades

These limitations make it difficult to optimize the trading portfolio and maximize success rates by leveraging historical patterns across stocks and over time.
2. Solution
Develop a comprehensive analysis system that combines:

Correlation Analysis: Identify groups of stocks that exhibit similar or inverse trading patterns
Sequence Prediction: Calculate the probability of success for each stock based on its recent win/loss sequence
Decision Framework: Combine correlation and sequence data to rank stocks and provide actionable trading recommendations

This system will process historical backtesting data to produce daily recommendations for the top three stocks to trade, along with directional bias and probability estimates.

Feedback loop for recommendation accuracy
Market condition adjustment mechanism.


Instructions
1. Use current code and implementation, logic, classes and method more. Read code first before implementing new requirement. 
2. Don't add extra knowledge, code, classes, logic or method. Be strict to the requirement given.

"""
Placeholder for Entry Strategy Implementations

This file is a placeholder for the concrete entry strategy implementations
that will be created in Phase 2 of the refactoring.

The following strategies will be implemented:

1. FirstEntryStrategy - For the 1ST_ENTRY type
2. TwoThirtyEntryStrategy - For the 2_30_ENTRY type

These will be separate files that inherit from the EntryStrategy base class.
"""

# This file is intentionally left empty as a placeholder
# The actual implementations will be in:
# - first_entry.py
# - two_thirty_entry.py

You want the following enhancements for the group list page (groups/+page.svelte):
Edit Group:
Implement an edit modal in the page (not a separate route).
On "Edit", open the modal pre-filled with group data, allow editing stocks/entry type, and call the PUT /groups/{id} API.
On success, update the group in the UI without a full refresh.
Delete Group:
On "Delete", call the DELETE /groups/{id} API.
On success, gracefully remove the group from the UI (no refresh).
On error, show an error message.
Add Group Enhancement:
After creating a group (POST), add it to the UI immediately (no refresh), using the response from the API.

Restated Query:
You want full CRUD (create, edit, delete) for stock groups, with all UI updates happening live (no page reloads), using the REST API endpoints as defined in server.go.
Implementation Plan
Files to Update:
frontend/src/routes/groups/+page.svelte
frontend/src/lib/components/StockGroupForm.svelte (for edit mode, if needed)
frontend/src/lib/services/stockGroupService.js (ensure edit/delete methods exist)
Steps:
Edit Modal:
Add state for editingGroup and showEditModal.
On "Edit", open modal with group data.
On submit, call editGroup(id, stockIds) API.
On success, update the group in the local list.
Delete Group:
On "Delete", call deleteGroup(id) API.
On success, remove the group from the local list.
On error, show error message.
Add Group Enhancement:
After successful creation, add the new group to the local list (using the API response).
UI/UX:
Show loading and error states for edit/delete.
Disable buttons during API calls.
Animate add/remove for smoothness.

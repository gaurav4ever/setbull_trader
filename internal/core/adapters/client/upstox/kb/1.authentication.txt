High-Level Design (Revised)

Authentication Flow:

OAuth 2.0 authentication with Upstox
Focus on obtaining and maintaining valid access tokens
Secure token storage and management


Historical Candle Data API Integration:

Dedicated client implementation for the historical candle data API
Efficient data retrieval and processing
Support for various time intervals and date ranges


Extensible Architecture:

Modular design to easily add other Upstox APIs in the future
Clean separation between authentication and API-specific components


Configuration Management:

Centralized configuration for Upstox credentials and API settings



Low-Level Design (Revised)
1. Authentication Module

Authentication Service:

Create upstox/auth package to handle all authentication-related functionality
Implement methods to generate login URL, exchange auth code for tokens, and refresh tokens
Store tokens securely with expiration handling


Auth Configuration:

Store API key, secret, and redirect URI in configuration
Implement secure access to these credentials


Token Repository:

Create an interface for token storage to support different backends (database, Redis, etc.)
Implement methods to store, retrieve, and validate tokens



2. Historical Candle Data API Client

API Client Structure:

Create upstox/api/candle package specialized for historical candle data
Implement a client that handles making authenticated requests to the API
Define methods for different time intervals (1min, 5min, 15min, 1day, etc.)


Data Models:

Define Go structs to represent candle data (OHLCV)
Implement efficient parsing and conversion between Upstox formats and internal formats


Request Builder:

Implement utility to construct proper API requests with all necessary parameters
Handle date formatting and validation for historical data requests



3. Extensible API Framework

Base Client Interface:

Create a generic upstox/api package with common HTTP client functionality
Implement method to attach authentication headers to requests
Define error handling patterns that all API-specific clients will use


API Registry:

Design a registry system to manage different API clients
Allow dynamic registration of new API clients as they are implemented


Context Propagation:

Ensure proper context handling throughout the API client chain
Support for cancellation and timeouts



4. Integration with Existing System

Service Layer:

Create a high-level service interface for historical candle data
Implement methods to retrieve and process data according to business needs


Adapter Pattern:

Use adapters to convert between Upstox data formats and your application's models
Ensure data transformation is centralized and consistent


Configuration Integration:

Extend your existing configuration system to include Upstox settings
Implement environment-specific configurations



5. Implementation Specifics

Historical Candle API Client:

Implement methods that match the endpoint signatures:

GetHistoricalCandleData(instrumentKey, interval, toDate)
GetHistoricalCandleData1(instrumentKey, interval, toDate, fromDate)
GetIntraDayCandleData(instrumentKey, interval)




Authentication Flow Implementation:

Implement server endpoint to generate login URL with required parameters
Create callback handler to process the auth code
Implement token exchange service for backend token acquisition


Error Handling and Retry Logic:

Implement specific error types for different failure scenarios
Add retry logic for transient errors with exponential backoff

Token store interface and token model
Client wrapper for the existing Upstox API client
Methods to generate login URLs and create authenticated contexts

Phase 2: Token Repository Implementation
File: internal/core/adapters/client/upstox/token_repository.go
This file will include:

Implementation of the TokenStore interface
Storage mechanisms (using your existing database or Redis)
Token encryption/decryption if needed

Phase 3: Authentication Service
File: internal/core/adapters/client/upstox/auth_service.go
This file will include:

High-level methods for the authentication workflow
Functions to exchange authorization code for tokens
Integration with the token repository
State management for secure OAuth flow

Phase 4: Authentication Controller and Routes
File: cmd/trading/transport/rest/upstox_auth_handlers.go
This file will include:

HTTP handlers for initiating login
Callback endpoint to receive authorization code
Integration with your existing HTTP framework

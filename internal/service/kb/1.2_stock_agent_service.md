Product Specification: Scheduled Group Execution Based on Candle Close
1. Overview
This feature enables the Setbull Trader platform to automatically execute trading groups at precise moments, based on the close of specific candles (e.g., 5-min, 1 PM) as dictated by each group’s entry type. The system must continuously ingest 1-minute OHLCV data, aggregate it into higher timeframes, and trigger group executions immediately after the relevant candle closes.
2. Goals
Automate group execution at the exact time dictated by each group’s entry type and associated candle.
Ensure accurate price context (e.g., 5-min high/low, 1 PM high/low) is used for order placement.
Minimize latency between candle close and execution.
Provide robust error handling, logging, and monitoring for all scheduled executions.
3. Use Cases
3.1. First Entry (5-min Candle)
Scenario: A group with entry type "first entry" must be executed immediately after the first 5-min candle (9:15–9:20) closes.
Trigger: At 9:20:00, system aggregates the 9:15–9:20 candle, determines high/low, and executes all "first entry" groups using these prices. Based on the stock direction, it will add positions above or below the 9:15AM candle
3.2. 230 Entry (1 PM Candle)
Scenario: A group with entry type "230 entry" must be executed immediately after the 1:00–1:05 PM candle closes. Based on the stock direction, it will add positions above or below the 1:00PM candle
Trigger: At 1:05:00 PM, system aggregates the 1:00–1:05 PM candle, determines high/low, and executes all "230 entry" groups using these prices.
3.3. Multiple Groups, Multiple Entry Types
Scenario: Several groups with different entry types (e.g., "first entry", "230 entry", "EOD entry") are active simultaneously.
Trigger: System must independently track and execute each group at its correct scheduled time, using the correct candle.
3.4. Missed Candle or Data Lag
Scenario: 1-min candle data is delayed or missing.
Trigger: System must log the issue, alert operators, and avoid executing with stale or incomplete data.
3.5. Manual Override
Scenario: Operator needs to manually trigger group execution (e.g., for testing or recovery).
Trigger: System provides an interface or API for manual execution, with audit logging.
3.6. Error During Execution
Scenario: Execution fails for one or more stocks in a group (e.g., due to API error, invalid price).
Trigger: System logs the error, retries if appropriate, and alerts operators.
4. Functional Requirements
4.1. Candle Aggregation
Continuously ingest 1-min OHLCV data for all stocks in active groups.
Aggregate 1-min candles into higher timeframes (5-min, 1 PM, etc.) as needed.
Store aggregated candles in memory or persistent store for immediate access.
4.2. Entry Time Scheduling
Maintain a mapping of entry types to candle close times.
At each relevant candle close, identify and trigger execution for all groups with matching entry type.
4.3. Group Execution
For each group, fetch the relevant candle (e.g., 5-min for "first entry").
Determine entry price (high/low as per group strategy).
Call the group execution logic with the correct price context.
4.4. Error Handling & Logging
Log all scheduled and actual executions.
Log and alert on data lags, missing candles, or execution failures.
Provide audit logs for manual overrides.
4.5. Monitoring & Notification
Real-time dashboard or alerts for execution status, failures, and data issues.
5. Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: Execution must occur within 1 second of candle close.
Reliability: System must handle data lags, retries, and partial failures gracefully.
Scalability: Must support hundreds of stocks and multiple groups concurrently.
Security: Only authorized users can trigger manual overrides.
6. User Stories
As a trader, I want my group to be executed immediately after the relevant candle closes, so that my strategy is followed precisely.
As an operator, I want to be alerted if data is missing or execution fails, so I can take corrective action.
As a developer, I want clear logs and error messages, so I can debug issues quickly.
7. Acceptance Criteria
[ ] System executes groups at the correct time, using the correct candle prices.
[ ] All executions are logged with timestamp, group ID, and price context.
[ ] System alerts on data lags, missing candles, or execution failures.
[ ] Manual override is possible and logged.
[ ] Unit and integration tests cover all major scenarios.

===============================
Phase 2 Implementation Plan

Goal
Enable the system to react immediately when a relevant candle closes by supporting event/callback registration and notification in the candle aggregation service.
File-by-File Change Plan
A. internal/service/candle_aggregation_service.go
Add a mechanism to register listeners (callbacks) for candle close events.
When a new 5-min candle is available (i.e., after Get5MinCandles or after 1-min ingestion if you want to be more real-time), invoke all registered listeners with the new candle(s).
Listener signature: func(candle domain.AggregatedCandle) or func(candles []domain.AggregatedCandle).
B. Example Listener Registration
Provide an example (in a test or stub) of how a scheduler or other service can register a callback to be notified on candle close.
======================================


Connecting everything together
How will the code check every 1-minute candle from 9:15AM?
The 1-minute candle ingestion and storage is handled by your existing ingestion loop (using CandleProcessingService and/or BatchFetchService), which should be scheduled to run every minute for all active instruments. This is typically set up as a goroutine or cron job in your main application entrypoint (e.g., cmd/trading/app/app.go).
This ingestion process ensures that every new 1-min candle (starting from 9:15AM) is fetched and stored in the database.
How will group_execution_scheduler.go be used?
GroupExecutionScheduler is a service that must be instantiated and registered at application startup (again, in your main entrypoint, e.g., cmd/trading/app/app.go).
When you create the CandleAggregationService, GroupExecutionService, and StockGroupService, you then create a GroupExecutionScheduler and pass these services to it.
The scheduler registers itself as a listener for 5-min candle close events via candleAggService.RegisterCandleCloseListener(s.OnCandleClose).
When a new 5-min candle is aggregated (as a result of 1-min candle ingestion), the CandleAggregationService fires the event, and the scheduler’s OnCandleClose method is called.
The scheduler checks if the candle’s time matches a trigger time (e.g., 9:20, 13:05) and, if so, triggers group execution for the relevant entry type.
Restated/Clarified Flow:
1-min Candle Ingestion:
Your ingestion loop (in main app) fetches and stores 1-min candles for all stocks every minute, starting at 9:15AM.
5-min Candle Aggregation:
After each new 1-min candle, the aggregation service can aggregate 5-min candles (either on-demand or as part of a post-ingestion step).
Event Notification:
When a new 5-min candle is available, the aggregation service notifies all registered listeners (including the scheduler).
Scheduler Trigger:
The GroupExecutionScheduler receives the event, checks if the candle time matches a trigger, and if so, executes the relevant groups.
How to Wire This Up (What’s Missing):
In your main application startup (e.g., cmd/trading/app/app.go):
Instantiate all services:
CandleAggregationService
GroupExecutionService
StockGroupService
(and others as needed)
Create the scheduler:
Apply to 1.2_stock_ag...
)
Start the 1-min ingestion loop:
Use a goroutine or ticker to call your 1-min candle ingestion logic every minute for all active instruments.
After each ingestion, call the aggregation service to aggregate 5-min candles and fire events.
Example Wiring in main.go or app.go:
Apply to 1.2_stock_ag...
)
Summary Table:
| Component | Who Calls It? | When? | What It Does |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1-min Ingestion Loop | Main app (goroutine/ticker) | Every minute | Fetches and stores 1-min candles |
| CandleAggregationService | Called after ingestion | After each 1-min | Aggregates 5-min candles, fires close events |
| GroupExecutionScheduler | Registered as event listener | On 5-min candle close| Triggers group execution if time matches |
In which phase is this wiring done?
This is the final integration step and should be done after Phase 4 (i.e., now).
This is where you “wire up” the system so the process runs end-to-end.
Would you like a concrete code snippet for your main app wiring, or do you want to proceed to operational/monitoring phases?


Below is a complete example of how to wire up the new group execution system in your main application entrypoint (e.g., cmd/trading/app/app.go or main.go).
This includes:
Service instantiation
GroupExecutionScheduler registration
A goroutine for 1-min candle ingestion and 5-min aggregation/event firing
Apply to 1.2_stock_ag...
}
Key Points:
Service wiring: All services are instantiated and passed to the scheduler.
Scheduler registration: The scheduler is registered as a listener for 5-min candle close events.
1-min ingestion loop: Runs every minute, ingests 1-min candles, then triggers 5-min aggregation and event firing.
Event-driven execution: When a 5-min candle closes, the scheduler triggers group execution if the time matches a configured entry type.
You will need to:
Replace /* ... */ with your actual dependency injection and service constructors.
Ensure ProcessIntraDayCandles and NotifyOnNew5MinCandles are implemented and available.
Adapt error handling/logging as per your standards.
This is the final “wiring” step that connects all the new code and enables the full scheduled group execution process.

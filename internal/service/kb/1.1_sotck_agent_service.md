Direct Answer:
You want to design and implement a service-layer process in Go that, when the /groups/{id}/execute endpoint is hit, will:
For each stock in the group, fetch live price,
Calculate SL and position size using config-driven risk parameters,
Create trade parameters,
Create an execution plan,
Execute the order,
All at the service layer (not via HTTP API calls).
Restated Query
You are asking for a design (HLD/LLD) and phased implementation plan for a Go backend feature that enables seamless, atomic execution of a stock group, integrating live data, risk management, trade parameter creation, execution plan creation, and order execution, all at the service level.
1. High Level Design (HLD)
Goal
Enable /groups/{id}/execute to trigger a full trade execution pipeline for all stocks in a group, using live data and risk config, without handler-to-handler or API-to-API calls.
Key Components & Flow
StockGroupService (or a new GroupExecutionService)
Orchestrates the end-to-end process for each stock in the group.
MarketQuoteService
Fetches the latest price for each stock.
TradeParametersService
Creates trade parameters (entry, SL, position size) for each stock.
ExecutionPlanService
Creates an execution plan for each stock based on trade parameters.
OrderExecutionService
Places the order as per the execution plan.
Config Integration
Risk parameters (e.g., SL %, risk per trade) are read from config (application.dev.yaml), loaded via config.go.
Transactionality & Logging
Each step is logged; errors are handled gracefully; partial failures are reported.

2. Low Level Design (LLD)
A. Config Changes
Add to application.dev.yaml:
Apply to 1.1_sotck_ag...
50
Update config.go to load these values.
B. Service Layer Integration
New Service: GroupExecutionService (or extend StockGroupService)
Method: ExecuteGroup(ctx, groupID string) error
Dependencies: MarketQuoteService, TradeParametersService, ExecutionPlanService, OrderExecutionService
Process:
Fetch group and stocks.
For each stock:
Fetch live price.
Calculate SL (price * sl_percent / 100), position size (risk_per_trade / SL).
Create trade parameters.
Create execution plan.
Execute order.
Log each step and collect results/errors.
Error Handling:
If any step fails for a stock, log and continue with others.
Return summary of successes/failures.
C. Handler Change
In stock_group_handlers.go, call the new service method in ExecuteGroup.
D. Testing
Unit tests for GroupExecutionService.ExecuteGroup.
Mock dependencies for isolated testing.
3. Phase-wise Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Config & Service Skeleton
Add SL% and risk per trade to application.dev.yaml.
Update config.go to load these values.
Create GroupExecutionService skeleton with dependencies injected.
Phase 2: Service Integration
Implement the orchestration logic in GroupExecutionService.ExecuteGroup.
Integrate live price fetch, SL/position size calculation, trade parameter creation, execution plan creation, and order execution.
Phase 3: Handler Wiring & Logging
Update ExecuteGroup handler to use the new service.
Add structured logging and error aggregation.
Phase 4: Testing
Write unit tests for the new service.
Add integration tests for the handler.
Phase 5: Documentation & Observability
Document the new config options and service.
Add metrics/logging for observability.

====================================
Implementation 

Phase 1 will add the required risk config to application.dev.yaml, update config.go to load these values, and create a skeleton for GroupExecutionService (in internal/service/group_execution_service.go) with dependency injection but no business logic yet.
Phase 1: Config & Service Skeleton
Files to Change (max 2, per rules):
application.dev.yaml
internal/trading/config/config.go
internal/service/group_execution_service.go (if new file is allowed, otherwise extend an existing service file)
Step-by-Step Plan
1. Add Config Values
  trading:
    default_sl_percent: 0.5
    default_risk_per_trade: 50


(If trading already exists, add these as new keys.)
2. Update Config Structs and Loader
In internal/trading/config/config.go:
Add DefaultSLPercent and DefaultRiskPerTrade to the TradingConfig struct.
Ensure these are loaded from YAML.
Add getters if needed.
3. Service Skeleton
In internal/service/group_execution_service.go (new file, or extend if already exists):
Define GroupExecutionService struct with dependencies:
StockGroupService
MarketQuoteService
TradeParametersService
ExecutionPlanService
OrderExecutionService
Config (for risk params)
Add a constructor for dependency injection.
Add a stub for ExecuteGroup(ctx, groupID string) error.

=================================

PHASE 3 implementation

Phase 3: Handler Wiring & Logging
Files to Change (limit 1-2 per rules):
main.go (or wherever the server and handler wiring is done)
internal/service/group_execution_service.go (for improved logging, if not already present)
Step-by-Step Plan
1. Server/Handler Wiring
In your main server setup (likely main.go or cmd/trading/transport/rest/server.go), ensure you:
Construct all dependencies (StockGroupService, MarketQuoteService, etc.).
Construct GroupExecutionService with all dependencies.
Construct StockGroupHandler with GroupExecutionService and inject it into the server.
2. Logging
In GroupExecutionService.ExecuteGroup, replace fmt.Printf with your project’s logger (e.g., log.Infof, log.Errorf).
In StockGroupHandler.ExecuteGroup, log the start, success, and failure of group execution.
3. Testing Strategy
Manually test via the /groups/{id}/execute endpoint and check logs for:
Start and end of group execution.
Per-stock execution results.
Error details if any stock fails.
Would you like to:
See the concrete file changes for the main server wiring and logging improvements?
Or do you want a summary of the handler wiring and logging approach before proceeding?
Please confirm, and specify if you want to limit to only 1 file in this phase.
